Mobile Architecture &amp; Programming


The mobile app I developed was designed to address specific user needs, depending on the option chosen in Project One—inventory management, event tracking, or weight monitoring. The app included key features such as user authentication, a persistent SQLite database, and SMS notification functionality. Its primary goal was to provide users with secure access to manage their data efficiently, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and receive alerts based on specific triggers. This combination of features ensured the app was both functional and user-friendly, aligning with industry best practices for mobile application development.

To support user needs, the app incorporated several essential screens and features. The login screen allowed users to log in securely or create new accounts, ensuring user-specific data was protected. A database management screen displayed information in a grid format and enabled CRUD operations, making data management intuitive and efficient. Additionally, the app included a permissions prompt for SMS notifications, allowing users to receive alerts for conditions such as low inventory or upcoming events. Even if users denied permissions, the rest of the app remained fully functional. The UI design emphasized simplicity and responsiveness, with intuitive layouts and visual feedback mechanisms, such as buttons and alerts, to make the app easy to navigate. This user-centered design approach kept functionality and usability in mind, leading to a positive user experience.

The coding process was structured and modular, beginning with a thorough breakdown of requirements. I implemented features in phases, starting with the database shell, followed by user authentication, and then SMS functionality. To ensure readability and maintainability, I adhered to industry best practices, including consistent naming conventions, concise classes, and detailed in-line comments. Each component was tested iteratively using the Android Emulator, allowing me to identify and resolve bugs early. This structured approach not only streamlined development but also ensured the code was scalable and maintainable for future updates.

Testing played a crucial role in ensuring the app’s functionality and robustness. The Android Emulator was used to simulate user interactions, such as login attempts, CRUD operations, and permissions prompts. I tested both granted and denied conditions for SMS permissions to ensure that the app’s core features operated seamlessly regardless of user choices. These tests revealed and addressed potential issues, such as incorrect database schemas and notification triggers, resulting in a polished, error-free application. Testing was essential to delivering a reliable product that met user expectations.

One of the most significant challenges during development was ensuring the app could function without SMS permissions while maintaining usability. To overcome this, I implemented conditional logic to disable SMS-specific features if permissions were denied. This innovation balanced edge case handling with user experience and highlighted the importance of adaptive design. This approach ensured that the app remained fully operational, even under restricted conditions, demonstrating my ability to design flexible and robust solutions.

A key area where I excelled was in developing the database shell and CRUD functionality. Designing a persistent SQLite database that seamlessly supported user interactions showcased my technical skills in database integration and back-end development. Ensuring data persistence even after the app was closed highlighted my ability to build reliable, user-focused features. This accomplishment reflects my expertise in creating efficient, functional applications that align with user needs and expectations.
